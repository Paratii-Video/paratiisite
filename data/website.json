									"title": "What is Paratii?",
									"text": "A non-profit entity that researches and develops technologies capable of changing the way you distribute and consume media online. You may have gotten to know us thgouh our research/educational initiatives, or through any of our products, like the Paratii player and The Lab web app (or 'portal', as some lile to call it)."
								},
								{
									"title": "Who is Paratii for?",
									"text": "We work with developers from around the world, and seek to foster technical talent to work on distributed networks such as Ethereum and IPFS, in Brazil. If you fit the profile, get in touch! We also help media institutions understand and leverage peer-to-peer technologies, besides promoting education."
								},
								{
									"title": "What problems does Paratii tackle?",
									"text": "For creators: demonetization, censorship and limited revenue options. For audiences: economic exploitation and lack of options. For advertisers: abusive prices and fraud in audience calculation. <br/>Paratii’s decentralized architecture allows the platform to exist without requiring the gigantic infrastructure of traditional centralized services, because participants share computational resources. Also, video monetization is entirely in the users’ hands, through contracts in the Ethereum blockchain. This works to free creators from institutions and platforms tied to the interests of large corporations - especially niche creators. Metrics and media opportunities are not held by a central agent, but public (respecting each user’s privacy settings) so that their value is dictated by the market without the necessity for middlemen."
								},
								{
									"title": "How is Paratii different from other video platforms?",
									"text": "In comparison to Youtube, Vimeo and such, Paratii distinguishes itself on two fronts: tech and business model. On the tech side because it is built on decentralized architecture, which makes it free from the necessity of housing gigantic warehouses full of servers, for instance. On the business model front, Paratii is unique in granting the power over monetization and curation to its creators and audiences, allowing for diverse options in sustaining the production of content. Importantly, Paratii also does not charge fees or take a cut of any transactions that happen in the platform."
								},
								{
									"title": "Who are Paratii’s competitors?",
									"text": "In 2015, Preston Byrne <a class=\"paratii-link\" href=\"https://prestonbyrne.com/2015/02/28/this-is-how-you-use-smart-contracts/\" target=\"_blank\">wrote about</a> using Ethereum contracts to execute micropayments in the distribution of video. Since then, an array of alternatives to traditional video platforms have appeared. Many claimed to be “the first decentralized video network”, but it’s hard to grant the title to one specific initiative. Each project tackles a specific problem, in theory, and many that may seem similar are actually complementary and need one another to function. Below, we list some of them:<br><br> <strong>Data Storage:</strong> IPFS, Swarm, Sia, Storj, Maidsafe and Decent compete in offering options for “peer-to-peer clouds”. They may be used as the “backend” for applications that need to communicate with large files and would rather not store them on the blockchain due to cost. They are analogous to Amazon S3, Dropbox, etc.<br><br><strong>Blockchains with a specific purpose:</strong> VideoCoin, Theta, LBRY.io, Alexandria and Steem are examples of blockchains dedicated to a specific type of application - they integrate identity, payment, data storage, load distribution and reputation in a single network, under a single protocol. That is to say, they don’t operate on Ethereum, Bitcoin, or any other blockchain, and allow applications to be built on top of them.<br/><br/><strong>“Auxiliary” services:</strong> Livepeer and Stream are examples of protocols that are dedicated to solving a specific part of the video pipeline. The first, for instance, provides a network of “transcoders” that prepare raw video files to be shown in many resolutions - the idea is to provide this service for applications that require it to offer optimal user experience on different devices and connections. At Paratii, for instance, we are experimenting with integrating Livepeer. That is, we are mixing different protocols and services in a single application.<br/><br/><strong>Content aggregators:</strong> SingularDTV, Viuly, Viewly, DTube, PopChest and Lino have their distinctions, but their objective can basically be said to aggregate content and provide portals where fans can sponsor artists. In most cases, they are against advertising. Some of them are built on Ethereum; others on Steem; some are even built on Bitcoin.<br/><br/><strong>Mobile applications:</strong> Props (YouNow), Current and Flixxo are examples of mobile applications with a similar purpose to the ones listed above. However, they are developed by centralized, profit-minded companies, and incorporate fees on certain transactions in order to maintain themselves.<br/><br/><strong>Curation and governance:</strong> Lightstreams and Userfeeds propose solutions for organizing and recommending content, in a way that could be integrated into video platforms.<br/><br/>The way all these layers of technology can interact is still unclear. A couple of them might make up what we would call a “platform”. There are also cases in which half a dozen or more might intersect in a single platform. Many that seem identical are actually quite different (e.g. WebTorrent x IPFS). Also, some initiatives that aren’t currently integrated to the ones mentioned above might soon become part of the group, such as Bidio for advertisements and Userfeeds for recommendations.<br/><br/>We are still in the early steps of a journey that is gradually redesigning the panorama for video, content creation and online advertising. A market of two billion people awaits disintermediation. The path towards that goal demands collaboration, patience and experimentation."

									"title": "I have a webpage or app that distributes videos. How do I use Paratii?",
									"text": "If you have your own domain, a Wordpress page or an article on Medium that could use some extra life, all you’ll have to do is paste a link like the following to show video on your content via the Paratii player: <a class=\"paratii-link\" href=\"https://portal.paratii.video/play/XXXXXXXXXXXX\" target=\"_blank\">https://portal.paratii.video/play/XXXXXXXXXXXX</a><br/><br/>If you’re a developer and want to use distributed video in your app, the <a class=\"paratii-link\" href=\"https://github.com/Paratii-Video/paratii-js\" target=\"_blank\">paratii.js</a> library was made for you. It’s used to read and write on the Ethereum blockchain, interact with peers on the IPFS network and search on the Paratii index, for instance. With it, we want to allow anyone to build browser clients such as The Lab app (we’ll provide a webpacked version for that) and also nodeJS based applications. All you need to initialize the library is the URL of an Ethereum node (the provider parameter) and the address for the ParatiiRegistry contract (the registry parameter). You can find current documentation <a class=\"paratii-link\" href=\"https://github.com/Paratii-Video/paratii-js/tree/dev/docs\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. Our <a class=\"paratii-link\" href=\"https://www.getrevue.co/profile/Paratii\" target=\"_blank\">newsletter</a> and <a class=\"paratii-link\" href=\"https://gitter.im/Paratii-Video/dev\" target=\"_blank\">Gitter</a> are the best channels to get update on the library’s development."

									"title": "How do I upload a video to The Lab app?",
									"text": "It’s quite simple: access portal.paratii.video, create an account, confirm your e-mail address and drag your video file to the upload zone. The rest should be self-explanatory."
								},
								{
									"title": "What kind of video can or can’t I upload?",
									"text": "In essence, any content related to peer-to-peer, cryptocurrencies or distributed systems that belongs to you or that you have permission to share, that is legal in its country of origin, and is not pornographic, can be uploaded to Paratii. Users that go through the upload process must accept the service’s <strong>terms of use.</strong>"
								},
								{
									"title": "Do I have to pay fees? How does Paratii make money?",

On Paratii, you don’t store whole files on your computer, but small random chunks of data. These chunks are stored in your browser’s local storage, and have no access to the device’s core memory. The user has full control over the expiration time of these files and how much space they’re allowed to take up, but <a class=\"paratii-link\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/+FrancoisBeaufort/posts/S5Q9HqDB8bh\" target=\"_blank\">this is usually limited by the browser itself at something between 5 and 10MB</a>."

Na tecnológica, por se sustentar em uma arquitetura descentralizada que independe de possuir enormes galpões de servidores. No modelo de negócios, por colocar o poder sobre a monetização e a curadoria nas mãos de criadores e audiências, permitindo diversas opções para sustentar a produção de conteúdo, além de não cobrar taxas para lucro próprio."

									"title": "Quais são os competidores da Paratii?",
									"text": "Em 2015, <a class=\"paratii-link\" href=\"https://prestonbyrne.com/2015/02/28/this-is-how-you-use-smart-contracts/\" target=\"_blank\">Preston Byrne já escreveu</a> sobre como usar contratos na Ethereum para executar micropagamentos atrelados a distribuição de vídeos. De lá pra cá, surgiram uma gama vasta de alternativas a plataformas tradicionais de vídeo. Muitas clamaram ser “a primeira rede de vídeo descentralizada” do mercado, mas é difícil entregar o título a uma iniciativa em particular. Cada projeto, na teoria, ataca um problema específico, e muitos que parecem similares, na verdade se complementam e precisam um do outro para funcionar. Vamos por partes:<br><br> <strong>Armazenagem de dados:</strong> IPFS, Swarm, Sia, Storj, Maidsafe e Decent competem para oferecer opções de “nuvens peer-to-peer”. Podem ser usadas como “backend” de aplicações que precisam se comunicar com arquivos pesados, e evitam armazená-los em uma blockchain por conta do custo. Análogos à S3 (Amazon), Dropbox, e outros.<br/><br/><strong>Blockchains com propósito específico:</strong> VideoCoin, Theta, LBRY.io, Alexandria e Steem são exemplos de blockchains dedicadas a um tipo específico de aplicação - integram lógicas de identidade, pagamento, armazenagem de dados, distribuição de carga e reputação em uma mesma rede, sob um mesmo protocolo. Ou seja: não operam sobre Ethereum, Bitcoin, ou outra blockchain, e permitem que aplicações sejam construídas sobre elas.<br/><br/><strong>Serviços “auxiliares”:</strong> Livepeer e Stream são exemplos de protocolos que se dedicam a solucionar uma parte específica do pipeline de vídeo. A primeira, por exemplo, provê uma rede de “transcoders” que preparam arquivos crus de vídeo para serem exibidos em diversas resoluções - a ideia é que seja integrada a aplicações que requerem esse tipo de funcionalidade para oferecerem uma boa experiência de usuário em qualquer aparelho ou conexão. Na Paratii, por exemplo, estamos experimentando essa integração, ou seja, mesclando os serviços de protocolos diferentes numa só aplicação.<br/><br/><strong>Agregadores de conteúdo:</strong> SingularDTV, Viuly, Viewly, DTube, PopChest e Lino tem suas dissimilaridades, mas basicamente se propõe a agregar conteúdo e prover portais onde fãs podem patrocinarem artistas. Na maioria dos casos, são contra propagandas. Alguns são construídos sobre Ethereum; outros sobre Steem; tem até aquelas que se sustentam sobre Bitcoin.<br/><br/><strong>Aplicativos mobile:</strong> Props (YouNow), Current e Flixxo são exemplos de aplicativos mobile com propósitos parecidos aos da categoria acima. São, no entanto, desenvolvidos por empresas centralizadas com fins lucrativos, e incorporam taxas sobre certas transações para se manterem.<br/><br/><strong>Curadoria e governança:</strong> Lightstreams e Userfeeds propõe soluções para se organizar, permissionar e recomendar conteúdos, podendo ser integrados a plataformas de vídeo.<br/><br/>As interações entre todas essas camadas de tecnologia ainda não são claras. Um par delas pode constituir aquilo que chamamos de “plataforma”. Mas também há casos em que meia dúzia ou mais se encontram, transversalmente, em uma única “plataforma”. Muitas que soam idênticas têm tecnologias na verdade bem diferentes (e.g. WebTorrent X IPFS). E algumas iniciativas que ainda não estão sendo integradas às mencionadas acima, muito em breve, devem estar fazendo parte do bolo (por exemplo, a Bidio para anúncios; e a Userfeeds para recomendações).<br/><br/>Ainda é o começo de uma jornada que está, aos poucos, redesenhando o panorama do vídeo, da criação de conteúdo e da publicidade no meio digital. Tem um mercado de 2 bilhões de pessoas esperando para ser desintermediado. O caminho passa por muita colaboração, paciência e experimentação."

Ela é usada para ler e escrever na blockchain da Ethereum, interagir com peers da rede do IPFS e fazer buscas no Paratii index, por exemplo. Com ela, queremos permitir a qualquer um construir browser clients, como o paratii-portal (vamos prover uma versão webpack’ed para isso) e também aplicações baseadas em nodeJS. Tudo o que você precisará para inicializar a biblioteca é a URL de um nó da Ethereum (o parâmetro provedor) e o endereço do contrato ParatiiRegistry (o parâmetro registro).

									"title": "What is Paratii?",
									"text": "Paratii is a new online platform for video that aims to change the way you publish and consume content on the internet. Through its decentralized architecture and democratic monetization model, as well as the flexibility to emerge on any web page or application, Paratii represents a paradigm shift and socioeconomic experiment."
								},
								{
									"title": "Who is Paratii for?",
									"text": "Paratii is for everyone who wants to distribute and/or consume video on the internet. From everyday vlogging to huge productions, the platform aims for the best and fairest experience for <strong>spectators</strong> and <strong>content creators</strong>. Further on, Paratii will also strengthen its relationship with <strong>publishers</strong> (websites, portals and apps that integrate video in their services) and media buyers."
								},
								{
									"title": "Is the service functional? When will it be launched?",
									"text": "Yes! You can head on over to paratii.video/join and start uploading your content right away. The portal is currently very basic but we're adding new stuff every couple of weeks. Sign up to our newsletter and keep up with our social media channels to be updated on upcoming features, such as tipping, public profile pages and community curation."
								},
								{
									"title": "What problems does Paratii solve?",
									"text": "For creators: demonetization, censorship and limited revenue options. For audiences: economic exploitation and lack of options. For advertisers: abusive prices and fraud in audience calculation. <br/>Paratii’s decentralized architecture allows the platform to exist without requiring the gigantic infrastructure of traditional centralized services, because participants share computational resources. Also, video monetization is entirely in the users’ hands, through contracts in the Ethereum blockchain. This works to free creators from institutions and platforms tied to the interests of large corporations - especially niche creators. Metrics and media opportunities are not held by a central agent, but public (respecting each user’s privacy settings) so that their value is dictated by the market without the necessity for middlemen."
								},
								{
									"title": "How is Paratii different from other video platforms?",
									"text": "In comparison to Youtube, Vimeo and such, Paratii distinguishes itself on two fronts: tech and business model. On the tech side because it is built on decentralized architecture, which makes it free from the necessity of housing gigantic warehouses full of servers, for instance. On the business model front, Paratii is unique in granting the power over monetization and curation to its creators and audiences, allowing for diverse options in sustaining the production of content. Importantly, Paratii also does not charge fees or take a cut of any transactions that happen in the platform."
								},
								{
									"title": "Who are Paratii’s competitors?",
									"text": "In 2015, Preston Byrne <a class=\"paratii-link\" href=\"https://prestonbyrne.com/2015/02/28/this-is-how-you-use-smart-contracts/\" target=\"_blank\">wrote about</a> using Ethereum contracts to execute micropayments in the distribution of video. Since then, an array of alternatives to traditional video platforms have appeared. Many claimed to be “the first decentralized video network”, but it’s hard to grant the title to one specific initiative. Each project tackles a specific problem, in theory, and many that may seem similar are actually complementary and need one another to function. Below, we list some of them:<br><br> <strong>Data Storage:</strong> IPFS, Swarm, Sia, Storj, Maidsafe and Decent compete in offering options for “peer-to-peer clouds”. They may be used as the “backend” for applications that need to communicate with large files and would rather not store them on the blockchain due to cost. They are analogous to Amazon S3, Dropbox, etc.<br><br><strong>Blockchains with a specific purpose:</strong> VideoCoin, Theta, LBRY.io, Alexandria and Steem are examples of blockchains dedicated to a specific type of application - they integrate identity, payment, data storage, load distribution and reputation in a single network, under a single protocol. That is to say, they don’t operate on Ethereum, Bitcoin, or any other blockchain, and allow applications to be built on top of them.<br/><br/><strong>“Auxiliary” services:</strong> Livepeer and Stream are examples of protocols that are dedicated to solving a specific part of the video pipeline. The first, for instance, provides a network of “transcoders” that prepare raw video files to be shown in many resolutions - the idea is to provide this service for applications that require it to offer optimal user experience on different devices and connections. At Paratii, for instance, we are experimenting with integrating Livepeer. That is, we are mixing different protocols and services in a single application.<br/><br/><strong>Content aggregators:</strong> SingularDTV, Viuly, Viewly, DTube, PopChest and Lino have their distinctions, but their objective can basically be said to aggregate content and provide portals where fans can sponsor artists. In most cases, they are against advertising. Some of them are built on Ethereum; others on Steem; some are even built on Bitcoin.<br/><br/><strong>Mobile applications:</strong> Props (YouNow), Current and Flixxo are examples of mobile applications with a similar purpose to the ones listed above. However, they are developed by centralized, profit-minded companies, and incorporate fees on certain transactions in order to maintain themselves.<br/><br/><strong>Curation and governance:</strong> Lightstreams and Userfeeds propose solutions for organizing and recommending content, in a way that could be integrated into video platforms.<br/><br/>The way all these layers of technology can interact is still unclear. A couple of them might make up what we would call a “platform”. There are also cases in which half a dozen or more might intersect in a single platform. Many that seem identical are actually quite different (e.g. WebTorrent x IPFS). Also, some initiatives that aren’t currently integrated to the ones mentioned above might soon become part of the group, such as Bidio for advertisements and Userfeeds for recommendations.<br/><br/>We are still in the early steps of a journey that is gradually redesigning the panorama for video, content creation and online advertising. A market of two billion people awaits disintermediation. The path towards that goal demands collaboration, patience and experimentation."
								},
								{
									"title": "I am a content creator and wish to migrate platform. What advantages can I find in Paratii?",
									"text": "Independent creators have been ignored by the big video platforms for too long. At Paratii, you are our number one priority, and everything from the underlying technology to the economic incentives carries that philosophy. The monetizing of your videos does not depend on a corporation deciding if they’re valid or good enough, and is directly in your control. You may opt for advertisements, pay-per-view, and even offer incentives for watching and sharing your videos, nourishing an audience and making it a community. Also, you’ll be able to hold tokens (official launch projected for Q3 2018) and reap the economic benefits conferred by them."
								},
								{
									"title": "I have a webpage or app that distributes videos. How do I use Paratii?",
									"text": "The service is designed to be universally embeddable on the web. This means that your website can have all of its video content “hosted” on Paratii, while at the same time showing it with no additional friction to the end user - superficially, it’s just like any other player. If you have your own domain, a Wordpress page or an article on Medium that could use some extra life, all you’ll have to do is paste a link like the following to show video on your content: <a class=\"paratii-link\" href=\"https://portal.paratii.video/play/XXXXXXXXXXXX\" target=\"_blank\">https://portal.paratii.video/play/XXXXXXXXXXXX</a><br/><br/>If you’re a developer and want to use decentralized video in your app, the <a class=\"paratii-link\" href=\"https://github.com/Paratii-Video/paratii-js\" target=\"_blank\">paratii.js</a> library was made for you. It’s used to read and write on the Ethereum blockchain, interact with peers on the IPFS network and search on the Paratii index, for instance. With it, we want to allow anyone to build browser clients such as the Paratii portal (we’ll provide a webpacked version for that) and also nodeJS based applications. All you need to initialize the library is the URL of an Ethereum node (the provider parameter) and the address for the ParatiiRegistry contract (the registry parameter). You can find current documentation <a class=\"paratii-link\" href=\"https://github.com/Paratii-Video/paratii-js/tree/dev/docs\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. Our <a class=\"paratii-link\" href=\"https://www.getrevue.co/profile/Paratii\" target=\"_blank\">newsletter</a> and <a class=\"paratii-link\" href=\"https://gitter.im/Paratii-Video/dev\" target=\"_blank\">Gitter</a> are the best channels to get update on the library’s development."
								},
								{
									"title": "How do I upload a video?",
									"text": "It’s quite simple: access portal.paratii.video, create an account, confirm your e-mail address and drag your video file to the upload zone. The rest should be self-explanatory."
								},
								{
									"title": "What kind of video can or can’t I upload?",
									"text": "In essence, any content that belongs to you or that you have permission to share, that is legal in its country of origin, and is not pornographic, can be uploaded to Paratii. Users that go through the upload process must accept the service’s <strong>terms of use.</strong>"
								},
								{
									"title": "Are there advertisements? Subscriptions? How can I monetize?",
									"text": "The form of monetizing content will always be in the hands of whoever created it - from running ads to accepting subscriptions, donations, or even charging per view. Currently, none of those options are enabled yet. The first one to be activated will be direct donations, then pay-per-view, and finally subscriptions and advertisements. In the medium-term, you won’t be lacking in options to be compensated for your work. Do you have ideas for a monetization process that we might not have thought of? How about jumping on our <a class=\"paratii-link\" href=\"https://t.me/joinchat/EWZMBQ9mnqJ1--NKHpyF8A\" target=\"_blank\">Telegram</a> and sharing them?"
								},
								{
									"title": "Do I have to pay fees? How does Paratii make money?",
									"text": "No! Creating an account on Paratii is totally free. Part of the issued tokens (12%) are granted to the Paratii Foundation, a nonprofit that aims to foster research, development, and expansion of the network. The foundation benefits if the platform is a success, grows, and the native token appreciates in value - which grants us the resources to invest in communcation, tutorials and training of the core development team, for instance. These tokens, however, will be issued slowly over four years, so that incentives are structured in a way to guarantee the sustainability of the technology in the long-term."

									"title": "How does the network sustain itself with no servers? Where are the files?",
									"text": "The files are distributed between the computers of everyone who uses Paratii and those who dedicate machines to serving content, and are sent to whoever requests them. It works similarly to a torrent, or programs such as Stremio or Popcorn Time. The file storage protocol we use for this is called IPFS, or Interplanetary File System."
								},
								{
									"title": "Can Paratii run on any device?",
									"text": "The current player prototype runs on iOS and Android as well as Mac, Windows and Linux on the Chrome, Safari, Brave and Firefox browsers. We are constantly working to add support for more devices and systems."
								},
								{
									"title": "Isn’t it dangerous to use my computer to store third-party files?",
									"text": "It’s as dangerous as browsing websites that use cookies - the personal information files that certain publishers warn you about storing on your machine (“this website uses cookies…”). On Paratii, you don’t store whole files on your computer, but small random chunks of data. These chunks are stored in your browser’s local storage, and have no access to the device’s core memory. The user has full control over the expiration time of these files and how much space they’re allowed to take up, but <a class=\"paratii-link\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/+FrancoisBeaufort/posts/S5Q9HqDB8bh\" target=\"_blank\">this is usually limited by the browser itself at something between 5 and 10MB</a>."
								},
								{
									"title": "Can anyone see everything I do on Paratii?",
									"text": "Not everything you do! Activity is anonymized, encrypted and is only sent out of your computer when it is directly relevant to an operation that must be executed. You’ll have the option to remain anonymous indefinitely (though you might feel a bit lonely!). Once conducted, transactions are public and irreversible - that is, if you decide to support a video with some tokens, other people may see it."
								},
								{
									"title": "Is the codebase open? How can I follow along?",
									"text": "Yes! You may follow the activity on our <a class=\"paratii-link\" href=\"https://github.com/paratii-video\" target=\"_blank\">Github repository</a> and even talk to the dev team or ask questions on <a class=\"paratii-link\" href=\"http://gitter.im/Paratii-Video\" target=\"_blank\">Gitter</a>. <a class=\"paratii-link\" href=\"https://t.me/joinchat/EWZMBQ9mnqJ1--NKHpyF8A\" target=\"_blank\">Telegram</a> is where you’ll find more informal chatting."

									"title": "What is the PTI token?",
									"text": "PTI is Paratii’s currency. It is issued according to codebound rules, its inflation is non-manipulable and its distribution rewards curators that help to keep content organized and filtered. Some functions in the platform require the user to deposit and “stake” PTIs, losing the ability to transfer them for a determined period but keeping ownership over them, consequently becoming entitled to rewards. As well a staking unit, the token can be used to pay for videos, make paid subscriptions or buy advertising, further on. <a class=\"paratii-link\" href=\"https://medium.com/paratii/pti-token-summary-edf048d36245\" target=\"_blank\">Click here for an in-depth summary of the PTI token, its uses, technology and distribution model.</a>"
								},
								{
									"title": "What is having PTI good for?",
									"text": "We have a nice infographic to explain what the PTI token is all about and what you can do with it - check it out <a class=\"paratii-link\" href=\"https://i.redd.it/3ypnjz1grdo01.png\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>."
								},
								{
									"title": "Couldn’t an existing token be used instead?",
									"text": "It is important that the token’s utility be contained within the services provided by Paratii, so that its value is not contaminated by forces external to the microeconomy it supports. Since it is a staking unit, it’s vital that the same token “stored” by the system to execute certain functions also be used to reward those that perform these functions in accordance with collective objectives. A third (but no less important) reason for an isolated token is the possibility of implementing a “monetary policy” that benefits the network’s bootstrapping - incentivizing early adoption, for instance. It should be noted that PTI is issued through the Ethereum blockchain, and compatible with wallets that follow its protocols."
								},
								{
									"title": "How do I get PTI?",
									"text": "First of all, any user that validates their registration gets a few PTI to start experimenting. This “initial gift” will be reduced in accordance to the userbase’s growth. There are a few different ways of <strong>acquiring</strong> PTI - the most direct one is to buy them from other users or exchanges with money, when the token is on the main net and is sold through third parties. It will be possible to <strong>earn</strong> PTI when interacting with the system in three different ways beside the initial gift: watching a video on the player, contributing to the curation of content uploaded to the system, or running a dedicated machine to serve content on the network."
								},
								{
									"title": "Can it be mined?",
									"text": "Yes and no - PTI cannot be mined in the same way as Bitcoin, for instance, in which users dedicate processing power to compete for computing on the blockchain. The PTI is mintable by validating an identity and being an active staker at each given block, where active stakers are either well-behaving publishers or assertive curators."
								},
								{
									"title": "How many PTI can there be?",
									"text": "The number of PTI tokens in existance will never go beyond 150 million. The issuance of new units slows down exponentially as the quantity available to the market approaches that number."
								},
								{
									"title": "Can I get PTI yet?",
									"text": "Our plan is to initiate public distribution of the token in August. Keep an eye on our newsletter and social media channels to learn more as we approach that date."
								},
								{
									"title": "What factors can appreciate or depreciate PTI’s value?",
									"text": "Supply and demand. The only factors that directly determine PTI’s market price are the market forces - the prices set in executed buy and sell orders. Demand may rise as creators seek out tokens to support or promote their videos, users participate in the curation process to get rewards, media buyers become interested in advertising on the platform or speculators bet on the platform’s future. On the supply side, the price may go down if users sell their tokens en masse; but it may also go up as tokens are staked and become frozen for a period, or as tokens become lost (deducted from circulation) or unredeemed by anonymous users who don’t know any better."
