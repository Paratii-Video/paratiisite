For advertisers: abusive prices and fraud in audience calculation. <br/>Paratii’s decentralized architecture allows the platform to exist without requiring the gigantic infrastructure of traditional centralized services, because participants share computational resources. Also, video monetization is entirely in the users’ hands, through contracts in the Ethereum blockchain. This works to free creators from institutions and platforms tied to the interests of large corporations - especially niche creators. Metrics and media opportunities are not held by a central agent, but public (respecting each user’s privacy settings) so that their value is dictated by the market without the necessity for middlemen."

On the tech side because it is built on decentralized architecture, which makes it free from the necessity of housing gigantic warehouses full of servers, for instance. On the business model front, Paratii is unique in granting the power over monetization and curation to its creators and audiences, allowing for diverse options in sustaining the production of content. Importantly, Paratii also does not charge fees or take a cut of any transactions that happen in the platform."

                  "text": "In 2015, Preston Byrne <a class=\"paratii-link\" href=\"https://prestonbyrne.com/2015/02/28/this-is-how-you-use-smart-contracts/\" target=\"_blank\">wrote about</a> using Ethereum contracts to execute micropayments in the distribution of video. Since then, an array of alternatives to traditional video platforms have appeared. Many claimed to be “the first decentralized video network”, but it’s hard to grant the title to one specific initiative. Each project tackles a specific problem, in theory, and many that may seem similar are actually complementary and need one another to function. Below, we list some of them:<br><br> <strong>Data Storage:</strong> IPFS, Swarm, Sia, Storj, Maidsafe and Decent compete in offering options for “peer-to-peer clouds”. They may be used as the “backend” for applications that need to communicate with large files and would rather not store them on the blockchain due to cost. They are analogous to Amazon S3, Dropbox, etc.<br><br><strong>Blockchains with a specific purpose:</strong> VideoCoin, Theta, LBRY.io, Alexandria and Steem are examples of blockchains dedicated to a specific type of application - they integrate identity, payment, data storage, load distribution and reputation in a single network, under a single protocol. That is to say, they don’t operate on Ethereum, Bitcoin, or any other blockchain, and allow applications to be built on top of them.<br/><br/><strong>“Auxiliary” services:</strong> Livepeer and Stream are examples of protocols that are dedicated to solving a specific part of the video pipeline. The first, for instance, provides a network of “transcoders” that prepare raw video files to be shown in many resolutions - the idea is to provide this service for applications that require it to offer optimal user experience on different devices and connections. At Paratii, for instance, we are experimenting with integrating Livepeer. That is, we are mixing different protocols and services in a single application.<br/><br/><strong>Content aggregators:</strong> SingularDTV, Viuly, Viewly, DTube, PopChest and Lino have their distinctions, but their objective can basically be said to aggregate content and provide portals where fans can sponsor artists. In most cases, they are against advertising. Some of them are built on Ethereum; others on Steem; some are even built on Bitcoin.<br/><br/><strong>Mobile applications:</strong> Props (YouNow), Current and Flixxo are examples of mobile applications with a similar purpose to the ones listed above. However, they are developed by centralized, profit-minded companies, and incorporate fees on certain transactions in order to maintain themselves.<br/><br/><strong>Curation and governance:</strong> Lightstreams and Userfeeds propose solutions for organizing and recommending content, in a way that could be integrated into video platforms.<br/><br/>The way all these layers of technology can interact is still unclear. A couple of them might make up what we would call a “platform”. There are also cases in which half a dozen or more might intersect in a single platform. Many that seem identical are actually quite different (e.g. WebTorrent x IPFS). Also, some initiatives that aren’t currently integrated to the ones mentioned above might soon become part of the group, such as Bidio for advertisements and Userfeeds for recommendations.<br/><br/>We are still in the early steps of a journey that is gradually redesigning the panorama for video, content creation and online advertising. A market of two billion people awaits disintermediation. The path towards that goal demands collaboration, patience and experimentation."

At Paratii, you are our number one priority, and everything from the underlying technology to the launch event carries that philosophy. The monetizing of your videos does not depend on a corporation deciding if they’re valid or good enough, and is directly in your control. You may opt for advertisements, pay-per-view, and even offer incentives for watching and sharing your videos, nourishing an audience and making it a community. Also, you’ll be able to hold tokens (currently projected for the first semester of 2018) and reap the economic benefits conferred by them."

If you have your own domain, a Wordpress page or an article on Medium that could use some extra life, all you’ll have to do is paste a link like the following to show video on your content: <a class=\"paratii-link\" href=\"https://portal.paratii.video/play/XXXXXXXXXXXX\" target=\"_blank\">https://portal.paratii.video/play/XXXXXXXXXXXX</a><br/><br/>If you’re a developer and want to use decentralized video in your app, the <a class=\"paratii-link\" href=\"https://github.com/Paratii-Video/paratii-js\" target=\"_blank\">paratii.js</a> library was made for you. It’s used to read and write on the Ethereum blockchain, interact with peers on the IPFS network and search on the Paratii index, for instance. With it, we want to allow anyone to build browser clients such as the Paratii portal (we’ll provide a webpacked version for that) and also nodeJS based applications. All you need to initialize the library is the URL of an Ethereum node (the provider parameter) and the address for the ParatiiRegistry contract (the registry parameter).

Since it is a staking unit, it’s vital that the same token “stored” by the system to execute certain functions also be used to reward those that perform these functions in accordance with collective objectives. A third (but no less important) reason for an isolated token is the possibility of implementing a “monetary policy” that benefits the network’s bootstrapping - incentivizing early adoption, for instance. It should be noted that PTI is issued through the Ethereum blockchain, and compatible with wallets that follow its protocols."

There are a few different ways of <strong>acquiring</strong> PTIs - the most direct one is to buy them from other users or exchanges with money, when the token is on the main net and is sold through third parties. It will be possible to <strong>earn</strong> PTI when interacting with the system in three different ways beside the initial gift: watching a video on the player, contributing to the curation of content uploaded to the system, or downloading and running a sorte of master node, which we call media node."

This program, in the vein of a master node, is fit for individuals who have machines with plenty of free space, server owners, or media vehicles interested in supporting and owning a piece of the future. When run, it allows the company to identify itself with an address on Paratii, Ethereum and IPFS (and soon, Livepeer); it allows the device to receive videos uploaded to the platform, prepare them to be watched in multiple resolutions, help to store and index them, and assist in distribution as a gateway."

Demand may rise as creators seek out tokens to support or promote their videos, users participate in the curation process to get rewards, media buyers become interested in advertising on the platform or speculators bet on the platform’s future. On the supply side, the price may go down if users sell their tokens en masse; but it may also go up as tokens are staked and become frozen for a period, or as tokens become lost (deducted from circulation) or unredeemed by anonymous users who don’t know any better."

Além disso, a monetização dos vídeos é gerida diretamente pelos usuários, entre si, por meio de contratos na blockchain da Ethereum, o que serve para libertar os criadores das amarras de instituições e plataformas presas aos interesses de grandes empresas - principalmente os criadores de nicho. Informações históricas e oportunidades de mídia não são resguardadas por um agente central, mas sim públicas (na medida da privacidade exigida por cada usuário), para que se extraia delas o valor ditado pelo mercado, livre de margens para terceiros."

                  "text": "Em 2015, <a class=\"paratii-link\" href=\"https://prestonbyrne.com/2015/02/28/this-is-how-you-use-smart-contracts/\" target=\"_blank\">Preston Byrne já escreveu</a> sobre como usar contratos na Ethereum para executar micropagamentos atrelados a distribuição de vídeos. De lá pra cá, surgiram uma gama vasta de alternativas a plataformas tradicionais de vídeo. Muitas clamaram ser “a primeira rede de vídeo descentralizada” do mercado, mas é difícil entregar o título a uma iniciativa em particular. Cada projeto, na teoria, ataca um problema específico, e muitos que parecem similares, na verdade se complementam e precisam um do outro para funcionar. Vamos por partes:<br><br> <strong>Armazenagem de dados:</strong> IPFS, Swarm, Sia, Storj, Maidsafe e Decent competem para oferecer opções de “nuvens peer-to-peer”. Podem ser usadas como “backend” de aplicações que precisam se comunicar com arquivos pesados, e evitam armazená-los em uma blockchain por conta do custo. Análogos à S3 (Amazon), Dropbox, e outros.<br/><br/><strong>Blockchains com propósito específico:</strong> VideoCoin, Theta, LBRY.io, Alexandria e Steem são exemplos de blockchains dedicadas a um tipo específico de aplicação - integram lógicas de identidade, pagamento, armazenagem de dados, distribuição de carga e reputação em uma mesma rede, sob um mesmo protocolo. Ou seja: não operam sobre Ethereum, Bitcoin, ou outra blockchain, e permitem que aplicações sejam construídas sobre elas.<br/><br/><strong>Serviços “auxiliares”:</strong> Livepeer e Stream são exemplos de protocolos que se dedicam a solucionar uma parte específica do pipeline de vídeo. A primeira, por exemplo, provê uma rede de “transcoders” que preparam arquivos crus de vídeo para serem exibidos em diversas resoluções - a ideia é que seja integrada a aplicações que requerem esse tipo de funcionalidade para oferecerem uma boa experiência de usuário em qualquer aparelho ou conexão. Na Paratii, por exemplo, estamos experimentando essa integração, ou seja, mesclando os serviços de protocolos diferentes numa só aplicação.<br/><br/><strong>Agregadores de conteúdo:</strong> SingularDTV, Viuly, Viewly, DTube, PopChest e Lino tem suas dissimilaridades, mas basicamente se propõe a agregar conteúdo e prover portais onde fãs podem patrocinarem artistas. Na maioria dos casos, são contra propagandas. Alguns são construídos sobre Ethereum; outros sobre Steem; tem até aquelas que se sustentam sobre Bitcoin.<br/><br/><strong>Aplicativos mobile:</strong> Props (YouNow), Current e Flixxo são exemplos de aplicativos mobile com propósitos parecidos aos da categoria acima. São, no entanto, desenvolvidos por empresas centralizadas com fins lucrativos, e incorporam taxas sobre certas transações para se manterem.<br/><br/><strong>Curadoria e governança:</strong> Lightstreams e Userfeeds propõe soluções para se organizar, permissionar e recomendar conteúdos, podendo ser integrados a plataformas de vídeo.<br/><br/>As interações entre todas essas camadas de tecnologia ainda não são claras. Um par delas pode constituir aquilo que chamamos de “plataforma”. Mas também há casos em que meia dúzia ou mais se encontram, transversalmente, em uma única “plataforma”. Muitas que soam idênticas têm tecnologias na verdade bem diferentes (e.g. WebTorrent X IPFS). E algumas iniciativas que ainda não estão sendo integradas às mencionadas acima, muito em breve, devem estar fazendo parte do bolo (por exemplo, a Bidio para anúncios; e a Userfeeds para recomendações).<br/><br/>Ainda é o começo de uma jornada que está, aos poucos, redesenhando o panorama do vídeo, da criação de conteúdo e da publicidade no meio digital. Tem um mercado de 2 bilhões de pessoas esperando para ser desintermediado. O caminho passa por muita colaboração, paciência e experimentação."

Na Paratii, vocês são nossa prioridade número um, e tudo desde a tecnologia até o lançamento da plataforma transparece essa filosofia. A monetização dos seus vídeos não depende de uma corporação decidir que eles são ou não válidos ou bons o suficiente, e está diretamente nas suas mãos. Você vai poder optar por publicidade, pay-per-view, e até mesmo oferecer incentivos para seus vídeos serem assistidos ou compartilhados, nutrindo a audiência e transformando-a em comunidade. Além disso, vai poder holdar tokens (cujo lançamento é projetado para o primeiro semestre de 2018) e se valer dos benefícios econômicos conferidos por eles."

Algumas funções do sistema exigem que o usuário “aposte” PTIs, perdendo a capacidade de transferí-los por um período determinado, mas continuando a ser dono deles, para ter o direito de receber rendimentos em seguida. Além de unidade nativa de “staking”, para esse tipo de função, o token também poderá ser usado para se pagar por vídeos, fazer assinaturas pagas ou comprar publicidade, mais à frente."

Como trata-se de uma unidade de staking, é imprescindível que o mesmo token “guardado” pelo sistema para se executar certas funções seja usado para recompensar aqueles que performam tais funções de acordo com os objetivos coletivos. Uma terceira (mas não menos importante) razão para um token isolado é a possibilidade de se implementar uma “política monetária” que influencie positivamente no bootstrap da rede - por exemplo, incentivando early adopters. Vale ressaltar que o PTI é emitido sobre a blockchain da Ethereum, e compatível com carteiras que sigam os padrões da rede-mãe."

Esse “presente incial” vai diminuir conforme a base de usuários crescer. Há algumas formas diferentes de se <strong>adquirir</strong> PTIs - a mais direta é comprá-los de outros usuários ou corretoras com dinheiro, quando o token estiver na main net e for vendido em plataformas terceiras. Será possível <strong>ganhar</strong> PTIs ao se interagir com o sistema de três formas (além da citada anteriormente, na validação do cadastro): assistindo a um vídeo no player; contribuindo na curadoria do conteúdo subido no sistema; ou baixando e rodando uma espécie de master node, que chamamos de media node, ou “nó de mídia”."

Do lado da oferta, o preço pode ser puxado para baixo se usuários venderem seus tokens em massa; mas também pode subir conforme tokens forem “apostados” e ficarem presos por certos períodos, ou conforme tokens forem perdidos (deduzidos da oferta corrente) ou não-resgatados por usuários anônimos desavisados.

For advertisers: abusive prices and fraud in audience calculation. <br/>Paratii’s decentralized architecture allows the platform to exist without requiring the gigantic infrastructure of traditional centralized services, because participants share computational resources. Also, video monetization is entirely in the users’ hands, through contracts in the Ethereum blockchain. This works to free creators from institutions and platforms tied to the interests of large corporations - especially niche creators. Metrics and media opportunities are not held by a central agent, but public (respecting each user’s privacy settings) so that their value is dictated by the market without the necessity for middlemen."

On the tech side because it is built on decentralized architecture, which makes it free from the necessity of housing gigantic warehouses full of servers, for instance. On the business model front, Paratii is unique in granting the power over monetization and curation to its creators and audiences, allowing for diverse options in sustaining the production of content. Importantly, Paratii also does not charge fees or take a cut of any transactions that happen in the platform."

                  "text": "In 2015, Preston Byrne <a class=\"paratii-link\" href=\"https://prestonbyrne.com/2015/02/28/this-is-how-you-use-smart-contracts/\" target=\"_blank\">wrote about</a> using Ethereum contracts to execute micropayments in the distribution of video. Since then, an array of alternatives to traditional video platforms have appeared. Many claimed to be “the first decentralized video network”, but it’s hard to grant the title to one specific initiative. Each project tackles a specific problem, in theory, and many that may seem similar are actually complementary and need one another to function. Below, we list some of them:<br><br> <strong>Data Storage:</strong> IPFS, Swarm, Sia, Storj, Maidsafe and Decent compete in offering options for “peer-to-peer clouds”. They may be used as the “backend” for applications that need to communicate with large files and would rather not store them on the blockchain due to cost. They are analogous to Amazon S3, Dropbox, etc.<br><br><strong>Blockchains with a specific purpose:</strong> VideoCoin, Theta, LBRY.io, Alexandria and Steem are examples of blockchains dedicated to a specific type of application - they integrate identity, payment, data storage, load distribution and reputation in a single network, under a single protocol. That is to say, they don’t operate on Ethereum, Bitcoin, or any other blockchain, and allow applications to be built on top of them.<br/><br/><strong>“Auxiliary” services:</strong> Livepeer and Stream are examples of protocols that are dedicated to solving a specific part of the video pipeline. The first, for instance, provides a network of “transcoders” that prepare raw video files to be shown in many resolutions - the idea is to provide this service for applications that require it to offer optimal user experience on different devices and connections. At Paratii, for instance, we are experimenting with integrating Livepeer. That is, we are mixing different protocols and services in a single application.<br/><br/><strong>Content aggregators:</strong> SingularDTV, Viuly, Viewly, DTube, PopChest and Lino have their distinctions, but their objective can basically be said to aggregate content and provide portals where fans can sponsor artists. In most cases, they are against advertising. Some of them are built on Ethereum; others on Steem; some are even built on Bitcoin.<br/><br/><strong>Mobile applications:</strong> Props (YouNow), Current and Flixxo are examples of mobile applications with a similar purpose to the ones listed above. However, they are developed by centralized, profit-minded companies, and incorporate fees on certain transactions in order to maintain themselves.<br/><br/><strong>Curation and governance:</strong> Lightstreams and Userfeeds propose solutions for organizing and recommending content, in a way that could be integrated into video platforms.<br/><br/>The way all these layers of technology can interact is still unclear. A couple of them might make up what we would call a “platform”. There are also cases in which half a dozen or more might intersect in a single platform. Many that seem identical are actually quite different (e.g. WebTorrent x IPFS). Also, some initiatives that aren’t currently integrated to the ones mentioned above might soon become part of the group, such as Bidio for advertisements and Userfeeds for recommendations.<br/><br/>We are still in the early steps of a journey that is gradually redesigning the panorama for video, content creation and online advertising. A market of two billion people awaits disintermediation. The path towards that goal demands collaboration, patience and experimentation."

At Paratii, you are our number one priority, and everything from the underlying technology to the launch event carries that philosophy. The monetizing of your videos does not depend on a corporation deciding if they’re valid or good enough, and is directly in your control. You may opt for advertisements, pay-per-view, and even offer incentives for watching and sharing your videos, nourishing an audience and making it a community. Also, you’ll be able to hold tokens (currently projected for the first semester of 2018) and reap the economic benefits conferred by them."

If you have your own domain, a Wordpress page or an article on Medium that could use some extra life, all you’ll have to do is paste a link like the following to show video on your content: <a class=\"paratii-link\" href=\"https://portal.paratii.video/play/XXXXXXXXXXXX\" target=\"_blank\">https://portal.paratii.video/play/XXXXXXXXXXXX</a><br/><br/>If you’re a developer and want to use decentralized video in your app, the <a class=\"paratii-link\" href=\"https://github.com/Paratii-Video/paratii-js\" target=\"_blank\">paratii.js</a> library was made for you. It’s used to read and write on the Ethereum blockchain, interact with peers on the IPFS network and search on the Paratii index, for instance. With it, we want to allow anyone to build browser clients such as the Paratii portal (we’ll provide a webpacked version for that) and also nodeJS based applications. All you need to initialize the library is the URL of an Ethereum node (the provider parameter) and the address for the ParatiiRegistry contract (the registry parameter).

Some functions in the platform require the user to deposit and “stake” PTIs, losing the ability to transfer them for a determined period but keeping ownership over them, consequently becoming entitled to rewards. As well a staking unit, the token can be used to pay for videos, make paid subscriptions or buy advertising, further on."

Since it is a staking unit, it’s vital that the same token “stored” by the system to execute certain functions also be used to reward those that perform these functions in accordance with collective objectives. A third (but no less important) reason for an isolated token is the possibility of implementing a “monetary policy” that benefits the network’s bootstrapping - incentivizing early adoption, for instance. It should be noted that PTI is issued through the Ethereum blockchain, and compatible with wallets that follow its protocols."

There are a few different ways of <strong>acquiring</strong> PTIs - the most direct one is to buy them from other users or exchanges with money, when the token is on the main net and is sold through third parties. It will be possible to <strong>earn</strong> PTI when interacting with the system in three different ways beside the initial gift: watching a video on the player, contributing to the curation of content uploaded to the system, or downloading and running a sorte of master node, which we call media node."

This program, in the vein of a master node, is fit for individuals who have machines with plenty of free space, server owners, or media vehicles interested in supporting and owning a piece of the future. When run, it allows the company to identify itself with an address on Paratii, Ethereum and IPFS (and soon, Livepeer); it allows the device to receive videos uploaded to the platform, prepare them to be watched in multiple resolutions, help to store and index them, and assist in distribution as a gateway."

Demand may rise as creators seek out tokens to support or promote their videos, users participate in the curation process to get rewards, media buyers become interested in advertising on the platform or speculators bet on the platform’s future. On the supply side, the price may go down if users sell their tokens en masse; but it may also go up as tokens are staked and become frozen for a period, or as tokens become lost (deducted from circulation) or unredeemed by anonymous users who don’t know any better."
